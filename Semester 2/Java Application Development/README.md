### A project I created in 2021 as a final project for the "Java Application Development" course at Humber in semester 2. The intructions given for this assignment was to make a Java program that uses MySQL to preform CRUD operations. Since I had some extra time, I decided to go even further with this project and experiment with the JavaFX Framework.

## Tech used: ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) ![JavaFX](https://img.shields.io/badge/javaFX-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
The program's design pattern is similar to MVC. Each model contains getters, setters, and a constructor. The closest thing to views in this application is the .fxml resource files. Each of these files contains XML code that describes how the scenes will look and their layout. The "HomeController" has two event listeners that display the scene that was requested. For example, if the "Staff" button is clicked, the home.fxml stage will close and the staff.fxml scene will load. In contrast, "StaffController" and "AnimalController" contain event listeners that close their current scenes and redirect back to home.fxml. What separates the staff and animal controllers is that they have methods called "initialize" which populates the TableViews as the scene loads. They also have methods that perform CRUD operations. They achieve this by interacting with a created object from the "Database" class. The "Database" class interacts with MySQL and executes queries.

## Optimizations
I feel like there is a lot of room for improvement regarding the cleanliness of the code. For instance, every time I create an FXML I have to repeatedly type code that creates objects, sets the title, sets the size, and shows the stage. What I could do instead is create a method that automatically does this for me and sets things like the title and size based on whatever's passed in the parameters. Perhaps the Database class could also be cleaner. For example, both Animals and Staff have their insert function. This could start to become more problematic if more tables are added. What I would do instead is just create an insert function in the database class that requires string parameters for the table, table columns, and values.

## Lessons Learned:
This project introduced me to three things mainly. First, I never used MySQL on a project like this before. It was very rewarding to see how I could visually manipulate data. It was also my first time using a GUI Framework like JavaFX. I believe I got a better understanding of how Scenes and Stages work. Lastly, this was my first experience with Maven. At first, I was confused because I was used to installing and adding .jar files to my project but Maven took care of all that for me.
